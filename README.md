### Preppin Data Challenges: Solutions with SQL

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my repository, where I tackle the **Preppin Data Challenges** using SQL in BigQuery.

**Preppin Data** is a fun, community-driven data prep project that mainly focuses on Tableau Prep. But, the community loves to experiment with different tools like Python, R, and SQL to solve these weekly challenges. Here, I'm diving in with SQL to work through each challenge.

My goal? To improve my skills and showcase what I can do with SQL and Python, all while having a blast solving these data puzzles.

Feel free to explore my solutions, and I hope they inspire you in your own data prep journey! ðŸš€
